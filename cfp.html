      <h2>Workshop Theme and Goals</h2>
      <p>
       Foundation models, including large-scale pre-trained models that often leverage self-supervised or multimodal learning, have significantly advanced various areas of machine learning. Their ability to generalize across tasks and data modalities makes them particularly promising for extracting robust representations from diverse, unlabeled health signals. Recent developments in transformer-based architectures, multimodal agents, and instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for richer interpretation, reasoning, and understanding of health signals. However, the complexity, heterogeneity, and noise inherent in such data present substantial modeling challenges. This workshop aims to foster new insights and approaches to address these challenges.

      </p>

     

        <h2>Topics</h2>

        We invite submissions on a range of topics including, but not limited to:
        <ul> 
        <li>Self-supervised pre-training on large-scale health signal data </li>
        <li>Open data and benchmarks for large-scale health signal modeling</li>
        <li>Multimodal learning combining signals with other health data modalities </li>
        <li>Integration of LLMs with physiological signal models for reasoning and QA </li>
        <li>Domain adaptation, personalization, and zero-shot learning for health signals</li>
        <li>Fairness, interpretability, and robustness in health signal modeling</li>
        <li>Federated or privacy-preserving foundation models</li>
        <li>Real-time health agents and mobile deployment of signal-based models</li>

          <li>Effectiveness of self-supervised, semi-supervised, or supervised representation learning approaches in a human-centric context, such as through user studies or benchmarking experiments.
          </li>
          <li>Learning and fine-tuning with human feedback and interaction (e.g., human-in-the-loop systems such as RLHF).
          </li>
          <li>Efficacy of multimodal data in learning approaches, including the integration of visual, audio, time-series, and text data sources.
          </li>
          <li>Representation learning for novel and underrepresented data sources.
          </li>
          <li>Explainable and interpretable aspects of the learned representations.
          </li>
          <li>Novel ways of encoding non-language data into pre-trained models and LLMs.
          </li>
          <li>Human-centric applications: Speech and audio processing, pose estimation, affective computing, activity recognition, egocentric perception, biosignal analysis (ECG, EEG, EMG, PPG, EDA, and others), electronic health records, imaging, and wearable data.
          </li> -->
        </p>

        <p>We encourage submissions from a wide range of disciplines, including machine learning, human-computer interaction, health data science, and related fields.</p>

        <h2>Submission Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Submissions should take the form of a short paper of up to <b>4 pages</b>. Additional pages containing references and appendices are allowed but the reviewers are not obliged to refer to the appendices when reviewing the paper. Submissions should be made on OpenReview in a single .pdf file using this LaTeX style template. The review process in double-blind, so please ensure that your submission is properly anonymized. Papers that exceed the page limit or have not been properly anonymized will be desk-rejected without review. Please note that there is no rebuttal phase and the final decisions will be made based solely on the submission and the reviews. Rejected and withdrawn submissions will not be made public.
        </p>

         <p> All accepted submissions will be accompanied by a poster presentation. A number of selected submissions will be invited for lightning and oral talks.</p>

         <p> <b>Dual submission policy:</b> This workshop is non-archival; even though all accepted papers will be available on OpenReview and this website, there are no formally-published proceedings. If a paper is currently under review at another venue, it can still be submitted to this workshop. If a paper has previously appeared in a journal, workshop, or conference, it should be reasonably extended in order to be accepted at this workshop. Parallel submission of papers under review at NeurIPS 2025 is allowed. </p>
      


      <h2>Attendance</h2>
        <p>  We will host a full-day workshop with multiple invited keynotes from academic and industry experts, oral presentations, and poster sessions to give researchers a chance to engage in discussion with the workshop attendees. recordings will be available to registered attendees. The last session of the day will be an interactive <b>panel on "foundation models for health signals in the real world" with all invited speakers</b> engaging with the audience through an open Q&A session.
