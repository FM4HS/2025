              <p><b>Title:</b> Generative AI for Clinical Trial Development</p>
              <p><b>Abstract:</b> We present three recent papers on how Generative AI can help clinical trial development:<br>
                1. TrialGPT: Matching Patients to Clinical Trials
                Recruiting the right patients quickly can be challenging in clinical trials. TrialGPT uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict a patient's suitability for various trials based on their medical notes, making it easier to find the best match.<br>
                2. AutoTrial: Improving Clinical Trial Eligibility Criteria Design
                Designing eligibility criteria for clinical trials can be complex. AutoTrial uses language models to streamline this process. It combines targeted generation, adapts to new information, and clearly explains its decisions.<br>
                3. MediTab: Handling Diverse Clinical Trial Data Tables
                Medical data, such as clinical trial results, comes in various tables, making it hard to compare and combine. MediTab uses LLMs to merge different data tables and align unfamiliar data to ensure consistency and accuracy.

              <p><b>Title:</b> Towards universal models for time series
              </p>
              <p><b>Abstract:</b> Foundation models have transformed deep learning by enabling a single model to adapt to various tasks without extensive additional training, reducing the need for training a separate model for each task. Although successful in vision and language, applying this idea to time series data presents unique challenges. Time series are characterized by diverse temporal dynamics, semantic variations, irregular sampling, and system-related factors such as different devices or subjects, as well as shifts in feature and label distributions. These characteristics are often incompatible with the next-token prediction approach of large language models. In this talk, I will discuss our research efforts aimed at developing capabilities for time-series foundation models. We begin with TF-C (NeurIPS 2022), a pre-training strategy for time series that uses a self-supervised consistency objective to make learned temporal and frequency representations consistent. We then introduce Raincoat (ICML 2023), a method for closed-set and universal domain adaptation. It is robust to shifts in both features and labels, enabling model transfer between source and unlabeled target domains, even when there is no label overlap. Our TimeX approach (NeurIPS 2023) provides an interpretable surrogate model for analyzing time series model behavior. This approach ensures model behavior consistency, offers discrete attribution maps, and improves interpretability. Finally, Raindrop (ICLR 2022) is an innovative method for handling irregularly sampled multivariate time series. It uses a graph neural network to understand time-varying dependencies among sensors, surpassing existing methods in classification and temporal dynamics interpretation. These approaches pave the way for foundation models for time series.
