              </p>
              <p><b>Bio:</b> Andrew C. Miller is a research scientist on the Health AI team at Apple, working on new machine learning and statistical methods for health applications. Before that, he was a postdoctoral research scientist at the Data Science Institute at Columbia University where he worked on methods for statistical modeling and inference with John Cunningham and Dave Blei. Before Columbia, he completed my PhD in Computer Science at Harvard University, advised by Ryan Adams, with a focus on probabilistic modeling and scalable inference methods. He likes to be application-driven; his applied work ranges from problems in astronomy to health care to sports analytics. On applications in health care, he has worked with Ziad Obermeyer and Sendhil Mullainathan. On applications in sports analytics, he worked closely with Luke Bornn.
