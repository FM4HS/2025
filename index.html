      <b>Human-centric physiological signals</b>, including electrocardiograms (ECG), electroencephalograms (EEG), photoplethysmography (PPG), and body sounds, offer a unique window into both physical and mental health. With the widespread use of wearables and mobile sensors, these signals are being collected continuously at population scale. However, their <b>complexity, heterogeneity, and susceptibility to noise</b> pose significant modeling challenges. Meanwhile, foundation models, i.e., large-scale pre-trained models often leveraging self-supervised or multimodal learning, have transformed several domains of machine learning. Their potential to generalize across tasks and data types makes them well-suited for extracting robust representations from diverse, unlabeled health signals. Recent progress in transformer-based models, multimodal agents, and instruction-tuned LLMs opens the door to <b>richer understanding, interpretation, and reasoning over health signals</b>. </p>
      <p>
      In this workshop at NeurIPS 2025, we will bring together machine learning researchers, clinicians, biomedical engineers, and health technology developers to address key open problems in this rapidly growing field. We will focus on three core themes:  <b>representation effectiveness</b>, <b>application reliability</b>, and <b>deployment efficiency</b> of foundation models and agents in health signal analysis. Specifically, we will discuss:
        <ul>
          <li>How can we develop novel methodologies that effectively model the complexity, variability, and noise inherent in physiological signals?
          </li>
          <li>How can we ensure fairness, reliability, and interpretability in foundation models and LLM-based agents for such data?
          </li>
          <li>How can we design efficient strategies for deploying robust foundation models in real-world and on-device, resource-constrained environments?
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
