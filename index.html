      <b>Human-centric physiological signals</b>, including electrocardiograms (ECG), electroencephalograms (EEG), photoplethysmography (PPG), and body sounds, offer a unique and continuous window into both physical and mental health. With the widespread use of wearables from companies like Google, Apple, and Oura, as well as their introduction into nationwide biobanks, these signals are being collected at a massive population scale, generating an unprecedented volume of data. </p>

      <p>
     While there is broad interest in applying generative AI and foundation models to health, much of the focus has been on modalities like electronic health records (EHR) or medical imaging. Our workshop carves out a distinct and critical niche: <b>foundation models trained on high-sampling-rate, longitudinal health signals from personal devices</b>. This is not just a theoretical exercise; foundation models are already being deployed at scale by major technology companies, impacting the health predictions and insights for billions of people.
     </p>
     
     <p>
     The challenges presented by these personal health signals—such as their complexity, heterogeneity, and susceptibility to noise—are unique and require dedicated attention. FM4HS is specifically designed to address the pressing issues that arise from training and deploying models on data at this immense scale. Therefore, our workshop is distinguished by the <b>firsthand experience of our speakers, who have been at the forefront of training and deploying these models in the real world</b>. This workshop will bring together machine learning researchers, clinicians, biomedical engineers, and health technology developers who are actively working with foundation models on personal health data. We will focus on the critical open challenges in this rapidly evolving field, centered on three core themes: representation effectiveness, application reliability, and the deployment efficiency of foundation models and agents in real-world health signal analysis.
     Specifically, we will discuss:
        <ul>
          <li>How can we develop novel methodologies that effectively model the complexity, variability, and noise inherent in physiological signals?
          </li>
          <li>How can we ensure fairness, reliability, and interpretability in foundation models and LLM-based agents for such data?
          </li>
          <li>How can we design efficient strategies for deploying robust foundation models in real-world and on-device, resource-constrained environments?
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
